3.3 Reading Data 
Flat files are files that are 2D like a text file 
  --> .csv or .txt
  --> fixed width files: have predefined spaces in the file (if theres columns, the column size will be predefined)
      a lot of code involved 
  --> delimited files: .csv, .tsv, .tab (these are separated by commas, tabs, or separate values), delimited means separated by something 
        --> course, number, day
