3.3 Reading Data 
Flat files are files that are 2D like a text file 
  --> .csv or .txt
  --> fixed width files: have predefined spaces in the file (if theres columns, the column size will be predefined)
      a lot of code involved 
  --> delimited files: .csv, .tsv, .tab (these are separated by commas, tabs, or separate values), delimited means separated by something 
        --> course, number, day 
  
3.7 Piping
piping allows one line of code for multiple actions (import this, clean data, etc.)
only need to define data frame once at the beginning (Only to be used on a single object)
  --> daily_show <- readr::read_csv(file = "data/daily_show_guests.csv",
                              skip = 4) %>%
                                                              # this says import and save object 
      dplyr::rename(job = GoogleKnowlege_Occupation,
                    date = Show,
                    category = Group,
                    guest_name = Raw_Guest_List) %>%
                                                              # this says rename the already defined object 
      dplyr::select(-YEAR) %>%
                                                              # get rid of year
      dplyr::mutate(job = str_to_lower(job)) %>%
      # change all the jobs to all lowercase
      dplyr::filter(category == "Science")
      # filter the jobs that are in a science category
      
3.8 code chunks 
Need 3 ticks ``` then curly brackets {}
eg. ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
    ```{r cars} --> use r because that's the language, and cars which is the title. the include=FALSE is a chunk option
