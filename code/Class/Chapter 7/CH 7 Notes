complete.cases() is a function that returns a logical vector showing which rows are complete (no mising values)
e.g. 
  df_mpg %>% 
    filter(!complete.cases(.))
dot acts as a placeholder argument when more than one function is nested iwthin a single seciton of pipe. The following all result in the same thing: 
  df_mpg %>% filter(!complete.cases(.))
  df_mpg %>% filter(!complete.cases(df_mpg))
  filter(df_mpg, !complete.cases(df_mpg))
