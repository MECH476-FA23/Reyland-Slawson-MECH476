stringr is a package in tidyverse that can help simplify string analysis 
library(stringr)
str_ function
  if you type str_ you can see the number of functions that stringr can do
  
subset pulls out section (like using ctl F)
  --> stringr::str_subset(string = names_respond,
                    pattern = "li") 
      --> returns "William" "Ali"

detect finds exact what is true and how many 
  --> stringr::str_detect(string = names_respond,
                    pattern = "Josh")
      --> returns: FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
    
split splits up all objects at the pattern 
  --> if you have mateo then use split 
      stringr::str_split(string = names_respond,
                   pattern = "t")
      --> returns: 
      [1]]
      [1] "Ahmed"

      [[2]]
      [1] "Josh"
      
      [[3]]
      [1] "Ma" "eo"
      
      [[4]]
      [1] "William"
      
      [[5]]
      [1] "Ali"
      
      [[6]]
      [1] "Wei"
      
      [[7]]
      [1] "S"     "eve-O"
      
      [[8]]
      [1] "John"

any letter followed by the numbers 3, 4, or 5	
  --> [:alpha:][345]
  --> brackets are regex
      alpha means any letter 
      brackets = following, number is conditions 
  
strings that start with ‘ID’ and are followed by 4 numbers	
  --> ^ID[:digit:]{4}
  --> carrot shows that it must be beginning then criteria (ID)
      [any digits] {culy brackets show the conditions}
      
regex shows up in quotes almost all the time 
--> string_replace replaces first of pattern, string_replace_all replaces all of the condition iterations
