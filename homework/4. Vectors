This one was the hardest one yet because I had to understand the vectors and how they were formatted. I'm still a little confused about how sep and collapse are different because they did the same thing, they both added spaces between the vector values.

Notes: 
Vectors don't need to be just numbers but can be a sequence of words strung together 
paste works like concatenate where it strings together vector objects
c() stands for concatenate, aka combine or make a string. 
  --> logic vector "TRUE" "FALSE" "FALSE"
      numeric vector "1" "2" "3"
      character vector "rock" "paper" "scissors"
      factor vector "red" "blue" "yellow" --> these are categories, could be round or blonde
      date vector "02-02-2023" "01-23-2021" "12-25-2024"
