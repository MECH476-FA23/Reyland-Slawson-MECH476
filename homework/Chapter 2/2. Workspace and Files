I learned about recursive and how to work around the directory. While I'm still a little confused, I was understanding a bit how the functions of R work and how they function. I also learned about how to set directories, nest them, save and create them.

Notes: 
Functions to note --> getwd = gets working directory
setwd = sets working directory 
ls = lists the objects 
dir = directory files 
args = gets the functions some argument will accept
