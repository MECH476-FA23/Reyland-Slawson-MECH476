This lesson I learned about how to format matricies. There was a lot of learning as the functions that rely on different formatting have to be in a certain order which was difficult to remember. 

Notes: 
matricies and data frames are similar but matricies only hold one class where data frames can hold more
can name columns and and see dimensions of the matricies or data frames with dim() and colnames() --> colnames function can be used to mass assign names to eaech column without having to individaully name each column.
