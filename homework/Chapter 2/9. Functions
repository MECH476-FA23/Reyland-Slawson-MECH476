I learned more about how to write scripts and use the functions in conjunction with each other. This one was kind of hard because you have to work backawards a bit and understand how you can easily add a criteria to a function without going the long way (eg adding length(x) rather than adding a variable that is length(x) and then using that variable in the function).

Notes: 
use double square brackets to unpack arguments 
from lesson: 
    good_morning <- function(...)
    args <- list(...) --> set up variable (args is used but not the norm) and make it a list of whatever is entered in the function
    firstname <- args[["firstname"]]
    lastname <- args[["lastname"]]
    paste("Good Morning", firstname, lastname)
